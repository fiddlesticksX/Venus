# Venus

Venus Educational Program or V.E.T is designed for True or False Quizes, it is a Console based program made with python and is free to be modded. There are no instructions to modding the program, but the program's code is easy to read. The code is Open-Source so **feel free to borrow code, just include me in the credits as "@footfella on github" :)**

The Project is distributed in a .EXE file format for users who want to use the program, a .PY file format for modders and a .ZIP file format for people who want to explore the code or mod it.
